### Online encryption decryption system
A onlie ecryption decryption system using JavaScript where you can encrypt and decrypt your file. It uses cryptojs library where I included most of the popular encryption methods such as
AES, DES, Blowfish and so on. I integrated some Hash functions as well which is very useful to check the integrity of any file.
