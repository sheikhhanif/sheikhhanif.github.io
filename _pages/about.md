I am an independent machine learning engineer.
 
My primary focus is on Data Science: analyzing data, automatizing processes, finding patterns, making predictions with optimized ML algorithms and quantifying the state of things with indicators. I find myself using TensorFlow and most of the open source libraries in Python for machine learning use cases.
